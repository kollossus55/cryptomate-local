/**
 * Trading costs — fees, spread and slippage.
 *
 * The original codebase had none of this. `grep -i "fee\|slippage"` on the
 * worker returned nothing, so a simulated 8% take-profit banked the full 8%.
 * Live, a round trip on Binance spot costs roughly 0.20–0.40% once taker fees,
 * spread and slippage are counted — about 10% of that 8% target, and it turns
 * a 3% stop into a 3.3%+ real loss.
 *
 * The asymmetry is what matters. With SL 3% / TP 8% and no costs you break
 * even at a 27% win rate; with costs you need meaningfully more. A strategy
 * that looks marginally profitable without this model is losing money live.
 *
 * Contract note (a standing source of confusion): for a BUY, quoteAmount is
 * the quote value SPENT. For a SELL, it is the quote value INTENDED TO BE
 * RECEIVED (base * intendedPrice). Callers holding a base quantity must pass
 * base * price, not the base quantity itself — a raw base quantity passed for
 * a sell fills a fraction of the intended order. The fee/slip computations
 * above respect that contract on both sides.

 * trade, not treat the estimated-fill price as tradeable. Callers that ignore
